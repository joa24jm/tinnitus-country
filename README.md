# Predict momentary tinnitus and tinnitus loudness using country, season, demographics and momentary assessments

## Research questions
- RQ1: Is the momentary tinnitus of TYT users classifiable using the features country, season, age, sex, and from the daily EMA questionnaire, mood, arousal, stress, concentration, and worst symptom perception?
- RQ2: Is the reported loudness of TYT users regressable using the same features like in RQ1?
- RQ3: Are we able to reveal country- and season-specific differences for the reported momentary tinnitus based on the daily EMA questionnaires of TYT users?

## Highlights
- Using ecological momentary assessments, demographic and geographic data, a patientâ€™s current tinnitus can be determined with an F1-score of 94 %.
- Using the same features as for the classification, the subjectively felt tinnitus loudness can be regressed with an average absolute error of 7.9 %.
- In our data, individual tinnitus perception differs between countries and between seasons, but the distributions of the worst tinnitus symptoms are comparable.
