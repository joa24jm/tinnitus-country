## Data preprocessing
The data comes from three .csv files, which, in turn, are extractions from the TYT database. The first file is a dataframe containing meta information from all registered users (number of users = 8685 by Feb. 2021). This meta data includes, among others, the country, nationality, and mobile platform. The second file is the baseline questionnaire and contains 3700 users that filled out the initial questionnaire. The daily questionnaire is the last file with 3044 users that answered 98,074 daily questionnaires. We can see from this, that of the registered users, about one in three completes the daily questionnaire at least once.

The \texttt{user\_id} is mandatory to merge the three data sets. As a consequence, all rows where \texttt{user\_id} equals \texttt{NULL}, we dropped that row. We further removed the 25 test-users with known user IDs to reduce bias and noise in the data. The remaining merged dataframe had 97,742 rows and 65 columns. This dataframe has been used for the statistical analyses provided in the results section.
